                While reviewing the outsourced IT functions at a very large global engineering services corporate, 
                information security was supposedly given due importance. 
                To our utter surprise, it was found that all the admin level user info including passwords, 
                IP addresses, and connection information were stored in an excel sheet. 
                Even worse, the excel sheet was shared with many outsourced staff on laptops that were neither securely configured nor insured. 
                The impact of the combined risks was then highlighted to the IT Top Management and corrective measures implemented forthwith.</p>
