            For a corporate with revenues in multiple billions, the IT service provider had done a patchy work on laying down the policies. Truetech made the Top Management aware of the criticality of having precisely worded IT policies including for Information Security to protect the corporate and its Top Executives from getting into unwanted legal complications. Also, while re-writing the policies, care was taken to reflect the security posture, 
            clearly spell out the roles and responsibilities, minimize malicious or unintended risks, and ensure compliance and better practices.</p>  </td>

        <td><h3>Technical review of BC preparedness</h3>
           <p> For a large chemical conglomerate that was implementing ERP software, a thorough review of preparedness of IT systems in case of any untoward incidents was performed. We observed that knowledge related to this was available in bits and pieces amongst several roles with no synchronization regarding updates to various components and no awareness on the implications. Truetech helped in laying down the right process to correct this scary situation. Truetech advised the importance of strict compliance to prompt documentation of changes, so that 
            IT staff would be able to take the right steps to confidently execute recovery steps after any system failure, and also periodically test the systems for recoverability.</p></td>

            Implementing a software solution without clear-cut domain knowledge is indeed perilous. Oracle Financials ERP was being used by the bank for consolidation of its annual financial statements. Truetech's consultants observed that even rudimentary controls had not been implemented, and hence the statements did not reflect the true financial position.
             After our assessment, all the corrective measures suggested by Truetech were agreed upon and effected by the client.</p></td>

            Post implementation of a major software solution, the Audit Committee of the Board for a large bank was not comfortable with the quality of findings as they found the same to be perfunctory. Truetech designed and developed an audit toolkit for the core transaction processing application, including detailed documentation and training of auditors in toolkit usage. 
            This resulted in speedy detection of anomalies and exceptions, relentless follow-up, strengthening the audit function and assurance to the Top Management.</p></td>

                Comprehensive assessment of requirements, design, testing and implementation of secure set up of over 100,000 end-user systems that are connected to several critical online transaction processing applications. 
                The objectives were not only to prevent unwanted exposures and errors, but also to enhance performance and improve user satisfaction. 
                Technology cannot work in isolation, hence a comprehensive user awareness program was designed and implemented to raise user awareness on good practices and its importance.</p>
